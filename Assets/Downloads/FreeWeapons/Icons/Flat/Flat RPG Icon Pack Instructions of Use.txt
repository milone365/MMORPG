Thank you for downloading my Icon Pack!

This pack features fully customizable item background which allows you to create
as many rarities of an item as you like.

To use this simply put the prefab of the icon you want in your scene's Canvas element
and change the color value from the Inspector of the "Background" element in the prefab.
In case you want to use the icons without the background, I have included all the elements
separated in another folder. (If you want to combine the elements yourself, make sure to
set the size of both the background and the icon to be the exact same to avoid mismatch)

I have also included a variation of the icons in 4 default rarities:
- Common (Green)
- Rare (Blue)
- Epic (Purple)
- Legendary (Yellow)

These can be found in a separate folder and are not separated by elements in case you 
only want to use the image for something else and don't care about creating more variations.
